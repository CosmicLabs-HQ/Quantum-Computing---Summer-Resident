# Quantum-Computing---Summer-Resident
Summer resident role optimizing real quantum circuits and integrating them into hybrid AI pipelines

**Location:** Brooklyn, NYC or Remote  
**Duration:** June–September 2025 (flexible)  
**Eligibility:** Senior undergrad, Master’s, or PhD students  

---

## 🌐 About the Role  
Work at the edge of quantum computing and AI systems. This role focuses on optimizing circuits that run on real hardware—not simulations—and wiring them into full-stack machine learning pipelines. You’ll help build hybrid systems that combine quantum precision with classical scalability.

---

## 🔬 What You’ll Do  
- Optimize and debug quantum circuits using Qiskit, QAOA, QUBO, and qGAN  
- Reduce circuit depth, manage decoherence, and increase stability under noise  
- Integrate quantum components into classical ML workflows and inference chains  
- Collaborate with AI engineers to embed quantum logic into real-world training and decision systems  

---

## 🧠 What You Bring  
- Hands-on experience with Qiskit or a comparable quantum SDK  
- Background in physics, quantum computing, electrical engineering, or applied math  
- Clear interest in working with **actual quantum hardware** and hybrid systems, not just simulators  

---

## ✳️ Bonus  
- Research or industry experience at IBM, Rigetti, Xanadu, or similar  
- Prior work on hybrid architectures that combine classical and quantum pipelines  
- Strong grasp of optimization methods (e.g. variational algorithms, QAOA/QUBO)  

---

## 🧭 Why This Matters  
Most “quantum” roles revolve around simulation. This one doesn’t. You’ll be working with a team that’s integrating quantum circuit behavior into real inference systems—used for networking optimization, agent orchestration, and multi-modal AI decision-making.

We’re looking for someone who understands the theory—but is more interested in building systems that *run*.
